My projects with C++
## Bill Cart Generator Project 
In this project, I created a Menu driven code for Fruit shop. In which a shopkeeper can add a fruit or variety of packed products details(like price, fruit name, fruit price, stock capacity, delete functionality).
In this, I also developed menu for customers, so that he can purchase fruits or products or he can add fruits into cart so that he can purchase from it when he finds it suitable.
