My projects with C++
## Bill Cart Generator Fruit Shop Project 
In this project, I created a Menu driven code for Fruit shop. In which a shopkeeper can add a fruit or variety of packed products details(like price, fruit name, fruit price, stock capacity, delete functionality).
In this, I also developed menu for customers, so that he can purchase fruits or products or he can add fruits into cart so that he can purchase from it when he finds it suitable.

## Creating a program to make DATABASE for Employee and Team Details
In this project, I created a menu driven code for Employee and Team to store, display, search via id, search via salary, delete employee and team. For employee we are creating a database regarding their proffestional and personal information.


##### I developed these projects using STL in C++
